## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was able to apply both grid and flexbox layout seamlessly to give me the designed layout. Unlike other projects where I had to learn a new property or make a new discovery, this one is straight forward.

I am really enjoying the power of grid template area ðŸ˜‰
